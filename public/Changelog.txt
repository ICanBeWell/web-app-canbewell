CHANGELOG

---------------------------------

GLOBAL:

1. Added `rel="noopener"` attribute behind every link to improve security.
2. Reduced the size of the back button.
3. Adjusted class `.d-flex-col` in staticpages_style.css for it to control the paddings and margins of the buttons within it, instead of setting individual styles of the buttons.
4. In-app redirect links now open in the current browser tab. (used to open in a new tab)

---------------------------------

No Family MD/NP Page EN & FR:

2. Removed individual styles that control the paddings and margins of the buttons.
3. Fixed that there's no blank space before "ici" on the FR page under "Virtual Care in Ontario" section.
4. Minor adjustment to the paddings between elements.
